I want to build something that is part game, part meditative are project. It will be called Mu River.

Imagine looking at a flowing river of viscous white paint. Your vantage point is right above the river. You can't see the banks, only the white paint flowing from the bottom of the screen to the top. In fact, when you first look at it, it looks almost like nothing is happening, but if you play close attention you see the paint curling and whirling gently.

As you observe the river, something happens. A small island starts to emerge from under the flow. The island is curved in shape, a little like a pebble, and its terrain is organic, leading from the edges, which are at the same level as the white paint, to a single peak more or less in the center of the island. It can take 5-20 seconds for the island to emerge in its entirety. The island is all made of dense pigment of a certain color. The denser the pigment is (closer to the center and the peak), the darker it is, in some places even black. As the island finishes emerging and settles, the current of white paint start to erode the edges of the island, slowly pulling away color pigments which swirls and curl and vortices as they are taken by the current, creating a beautiful organic upwards flow of strong color in the river, which continues and leaves the top of the screen as there is no boundary there. In a process that takes anywhere between 20 seconds and a minute, the white paint slowly and gradually breaks the entirety of the island, releasing its pigments into the white fluid upstream until there is no pigment or island left.

Now imagine another island appears, with a different color, going through the same process. And another appears before the second one even disappears, and so on. The islands appear randomly on the screen (but never overlap), so sometimes their flow of pigment mixes together to create a new color.

This is what I call, in this game, "observer mode".

But there is also "active mode". As you tap/click the screen, and wherever you tap, a new island emerges (again, making sure not to overlap with existing islands). The longer the click, the bigger and denser the island (though there is a max size limit). You are limited to 12 islands at the screen at the same time at most. Now you can play with the positioning and size of the islands to create your own effects.


In the background, ambient meditative music is playing, which you can turn off.

I was thinking of using Three.JS with additional GLSL for shaders. Ideally, it uses using Bun and Parcel, and when ready can be served from a browser or a native phone app.
